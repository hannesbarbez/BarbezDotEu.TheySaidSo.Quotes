# BarbezDotEu.TheySaidSo.Quotes.QuoteOfTheDay

An unofficial, modern client for the free "Quote of the day" of the 'They Said So® Famous Quotes API' at [quotes.rest](https://quotes.rest/).

# General Usage

Create an API key at https://theysaidso.com/api, then use this client according to the rate limits on the same page.
While this library has support for rate limiting (via the underlying [BarbezDotEu.Provider](https://www.nuget.org/packages/BarbezDotEu.Provider)), ultimately it is up to a consumer of this client to ensure rate limits are respected. 

The client's source code is governed by the GPL-3.0 license.

Your use of this client is governed by https://theysaidso.com/terms#api.
